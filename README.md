Looking forward to hearing all the great ideas at the CSTA Annual Conference but just can’t sit still? 

Want to help a child in distress by helping crowd-knit and crowd-crochet blankets that we’ll donate to [Project Linus](https://www.projectlinus.org/)?

Join us at the GitHub table in the vendors area. 

We will teach you how to knit or crochet, give you the yarn and the needles  and then set you loose to enjoy the conference. 

If you already knit or crochet, come by the GitHub table, grab supplies, get back to the conference and knit away.

Instructions (if you already knit or crochet):

  - Use a worsted weight (medium weight) acrylic yarn using any pattern that makes you happy.
  - Knit or crochet 7” x 9” blocks (or 9” X 7”, direction doesn’t matter)
  - Drop off completed squares at the GitHub booth.
  - YOU CAN BRING COMPLETED BLOCKS WITH YOU TO THE CONFERENCE


And if you want to bring your own supplies, knitting needles are permitted in carry on bags as per [TSA](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/knitting-needles).
